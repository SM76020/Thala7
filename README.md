# Thala for a Reason

Welcome to the "Thala for a Reason" project - where fun meets randomness! üöÄ

## What's this project about?

Thala for a Reason is a delightful web app that combines numerology, wordplay, and MS Dhoni magic. You input something, and the app decides if there's a "Thala for a Reason" or if it's just an "Oops" moment.

## How to Use

1. Enter any text or number in the input field.
2. Click the "Submit" button.
3. Witness the magic unfold!

## Magic Moments

If your input equals 7 or has 7 letters, you'll get the glorious proclamation: "Thala for a Reason." üèè‚ú® And what's more, you'll be serenaded by the sweet sounds of Thala MS Dhoni in the background.

If not, brace yourself for an "Oops!" moment.

## Contributions

Contributions are more than welcome! If you have funny ideas or want to add more magic to the project, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's make Thala for a Reason even more legendary!
